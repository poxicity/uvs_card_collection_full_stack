# uvs_card_collection_full_stack

Personal project I built to connect to a MySQL database on the backend that stores cards I own for the My Hero Academia TCG.  
It has a basic search function that looks for cards with the entered name and returns some information on them such as
Card Name, Card Set, and Card Quantity.  I built the web page as a way to check if I have 4 of the card that is entered
in the search.  In this particular game a playset is 4 of the same card and all you can play in your deck.  Any
cards above 4 are extra and not needed by me so I can trade them or give them away.

Future updates for this webpage will include better data display on the returned data.  More indepth card information 
in the database and better polishing of the site itself.
